🌤 Classy Weather

Classy Weather is a small educational React application built as part of Jonas Schmedtmann’s React course.
The project demonstrates how to build React applications using class components, before the introduction of React Hooks.

The app allows users to search for a city and view basic weather information, helping to understand how data fetching, state management, and lifecycle methods work in class-based React.
